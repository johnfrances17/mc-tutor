# Chat Files Directory

This folder stores all peer-to-peer chat conversations as JSON files.

## Structure:
- Each conversation is stored as: `{student_id1}-{student_id2}.json`
- Student IDs are sorted alphabetically (LEAST first, GREATEST second)
- metadata.json tracks all active conversations

## Why File-Based?
- Instant loading (no SQL queries)
- Scalable (doesn't spam database)
- Easy backup (just copy folder)
- Cloud-ready (works with any file storage)
- Better performance (direct file access)

## Security:
- Messages are encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Files protected by PHP (no direct access)
- PIN required to decrypt history
